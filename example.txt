Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that seeks to create systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence.

Machine learning is a subcategory of AI that enables computers to learn and improve automatically without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data to make predictions or decisions.

Chatbots are AI programs designed to simulate human conversations. They use natural language processing to understand and respond to user queries. Modern chatbots can handle complex queries and provide helpful responses.

Embeddings are vector representations of text that capture the semantic meaning of words and phrases. These vectors allow computers to understand relationships between different concepts and perform semantic searches.

Deep learning is a machine learning technique that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. It is particularly effective for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and machine translation.
